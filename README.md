# Machine Learning Coursework 1: Data Challenge

**cw1_submission_k23051132:** The output file containing the model's predictions for the test dataset.

**cw1_train_eda:** The training dataset after performing necessary exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as feature engineering and visualisation.

**cw1_test_eda:** The testing dataset after performing necessary EDA.

**eda.py:** The script for performing exploratory data analysis. It handles tasks like encoding categorical variables, feature transformation, and other preprocessing steps.

**final.py:** The final script that contains the fine-tuned Gradient Boosting Regressor model, which is used to generate the final predictions for the test dataset.

**final_model.pkl:** The final fine-tuned Gradient Boosting Regressor model.

**gbr.py:** The script that evaluates the performance of the Gradient Boosting Regressor model.

**ridge.py:** The script that evaluates the performance of the Ridge Regression model.

**lasso.py:** The script that evaluates the performance of the Lasso Regression model.

**rfg.py:** The script that evaluates the performance of the Random Forest Regression model.

**svm.py:** The script that evaluates the performance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
